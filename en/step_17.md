## What next?

Have a go at graphing different sensors, and see what patterns you can spot. You can also try accessing different Weather Stations. Here's a list of the `keys` for some of the other sensors.

|Sensor| Key |
|------|-----|
|Soil temperature|ground_temp|
|Air quality|air_quality|
|Air temperature|ambient_temp|
|Wind direction|wind_direction|
|mm of rain|rainfall|
|Air pressure|air_pressure|
|Wind speed|wind_speed|
|Wind gust speed|wind_gust_speed|
|Humidity|humidity|

Can you plot more than one data set on a graph? Perhaps you could figure out how to plot both wind speed and wind direction, for instance. Maybe you could plot the temperatures from several Weather Stations?
